This repository contains all the scripts and output files from the BS32010 project:

The data folder contains all of the various output files that were produced during the project, apart from the phylogenetic tree plots as they had to be produced out with the linux system and could not be uploaded.

RMAnormalisation.R contains the code used to normalise and produce the plots of each individual cel.

example.R contains the code used to perform Limma/Affy analysis to normalise and calculate the most differentially expressed genes of the cel files.

phylo-stuff.R contains the code that was used to test and create the phylogenetic trees used in the analylsis.

rnaseq.R contains the code used to perform the DESeq2 analysis on the RNA sequence counts file to get the most differentially expressed genes.
